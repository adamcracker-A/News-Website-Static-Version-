                                "The biggest benefit to everybody you can make is changing people's attitudes towards disabilities," he told BBC News.

                                Matt Duffer added that “The Boroughs” “probably shares the most DNA with ‘Stranger Things’ because it’s about a group of misfits who fight an otherworldly evil.”
