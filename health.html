                        <strong>More babies in England are being born by Caesarean section, latest NHS data for England reveals.</strong>  
                        <p>
                        Latest figures for 2023/24 show 42% of all deliveries were Caesarean.
                        The proportion has increased steadily over the past decade, and experts say it is linked to a "growing number" of more "complex" pregnancies - because the mother is older or obese, for example.

                            Cases related to the outbreak were first reported in January 2024, and there were two reported TB deaths last year associated with this outbreak, Jill Bronaugh, a spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, said Tuesday.

                            The latest science supports those concerns, but two recent government reports suggest potential benefits exist alongside potential risks – and some experts say that formal dietary recommendations, due to be reviewed this year, could take a more nuanced approach.</p>

                            The directive was made in accordance with President Donald Trump’s January 20 executive order withdrawing the US from WHO, according to a memo sent late Sunday from CDC Deputy Director of Global Health Dr. John Nkengasong to senior agency leadership, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. It was first reported by the Associated Press.</p>

                        MPs have voted in favour of proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will now face many more months of debate and scrutiny by MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament needed for it to become law. It is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all.

                        Travellers are being warned of the dangers of methanol poisoning after six tourists to Laos have died. Methanol is an industrial chemical found in antifreeze and windscreen washer fluid. It's not meant for human consumption and is highly toxic. Drinking even small amounts can be damaging. A few shots of bootleg spirit containing it can be lethal.

                        <strong>Sir Chris Hoy, six-time Olympic cycling champion, has revealed he has advanced prostate cancer. The 48-year-old said the cancer has spread to his bones and is terminal.</strong>
                        Tributes have poured in and charities say raising awareness of the disease could help save other lives. Prostate cancers can behave very differently. While some can spread quickly, others are very slow growing and may need minimal or even no treatment.
